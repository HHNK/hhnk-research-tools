# Installation
For development setup the python environment with:
We use vs-code as IDE.

1. Install [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/)
2. `pixi install`
3. `pixi run postinstall` -> install pre-commits


# Release
For releasing draft a new release on https://github.com/HHNK/hhnk-research-tools/releases.

The naming should equal "v" + the version in pyproject.toml; e.g. `v2025.1.0`

The [environment](https://github.com/HHNK/hhnk-research-tools/settings/environments) `release` has been created on Github and in it the secret `TESTPYPI_API_TOKEN` has been configured. Get this token from https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/ -> `API tokens`.

When this release is published it will run the gh action publish_on_release.yml.
This runs:\
`pixi run tests`\
`pixi run build_wheels`\
`pixi run twine_check`\
`pixi run twine_upload_test`
